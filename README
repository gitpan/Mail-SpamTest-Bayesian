Mail/SpamTest/Bayesian version 0.02
===================================

       This module implements the naive Bayesian spam-testing algorithm 
described by Paul Graham at:

       http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html

       In short: the system is trained by exposure to mailboxes of 
known spam and non-spam messages. These are (1) MIME-decoded, and 
non-text parts deleted; (2) tokenised. The database files spam.db and 
nonspam.db contain lists of tokens and the number of messages in which 
they have occurred; general.db holds a message count.

       This module is in early development; it is functional but basic. 
It is expected that more mailbox parsing routines will be added, 
probably using Mail::Box; and that ancillary programs will be supplied 
for use of the module as a personal mail filter.
